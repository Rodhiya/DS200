## Module 4 : Assignment
* * *

> **Aim of this assignment is to explore one of datasets in data.gov.in and plot in matplotlib**

###  Dataset
> The dataset is <a href="#my_anchor">[1]</a> **Primary Energy Consumption in Select Countries of the World from 2012 to 2018** and is  downloaded from [here](https://data.gov.in/resources/primary-energy-consumption-in-select-countries-of-the-world-from-2012-).
>> The data is released under ** National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP)** 

###  Files

1.  There are folders named as 'data' and 'plots' inside ZIP file. Along with these, python script, 'DS200Plots.py' is also there.
2.  'data' folder contains the data file, 'primaryEnergy.xls'. And all the plots are saved in 'plots' folder
3.  Along with these, I am also uploading the jupyter notebook, 'DS200Plots.ipynb'  

###  Plots
#### (a) Scatter plot

### Part3: - Lineplot
![lineplot](plots/lineplot.png)

1. In this lineplot, we have plotted primary energy consumption of whole world from the the year 2012 to 2018.
2. Units on Y-axis is in Million Tonnes Oil Equivalent.
3. From this we can see that Energy demand is increasing consistently over the last years and after year 2015, there is increase in slop also.
